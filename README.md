This is a **multi-class Java project** that includes the following classes:

1. **Book.java** – Represents a book with title, author, and issue status.
2. **User.java** – Represents a user with a name and auto-generated unique ID.
3. **Library.java** – Core class that manages books, users, issuing and returning logic.
